# Image_processing_fundamentals
It includes programming for image transforms, enhancement, color image processing, image restoration and reconstruction using MATLAB and GNU Octave softwares.
Procedures:
1.Consider an input digital image and convert it into binary image format
2.Plot the histogram to know gray level distributions
3.Apply different transforms and analyse the changes in images at input and outputs
4.Image restoration and reconstruction done by the blurred or eroded images using the algorithms
